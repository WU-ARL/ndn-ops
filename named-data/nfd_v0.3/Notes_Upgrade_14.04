Before upgrade, save a copy of:
/etc/sudoers
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades

Before upgrade, disable nfdstat_c and nfdDataCollection_c daemons:
(we need to do this until we get these two daemons added to the PPA)
sudo mv /etc/init/nfdstat_c.conf /etc/init/nfdstat_c.conf.disable
sudo mv /etc/init/nfdDataCollection_c.conf /etc/init/nfdDataCollection_c.conf.disable


--- UPGRADE TO 14.04 ---


After upgrade, add NDN PPA back in:
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:named-data/ppa
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install ndn-cxx nfd nlsr
