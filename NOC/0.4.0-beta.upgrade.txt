# As part of the upgrade to nfd 0.4.0-beta2 we are also going to get 
# rid of some vestiges of old installations if present. 
# We will also clean up some configuration and init files and turn on 
# some NDN status data collection tools


# First lets stop everything nfd related:
sudo initctl stop nfd

# nfdstat_c and nfdDataCollector_c need to be recompiled. The old versions,
# if present, will get stuck starting via Upstart and crashing and chew up a lot of CP.
# just in case here are the commands to stop them if things go wrong:
# sudo initctl stop nfdstat_c
# sudo initctl stop nfdDataCollector_c

# We are also going to change the way the ndnping server gets started.
# Here are commands that stop the two variations, just in case.
# sudo initctl stop ndnping
# sudo initctl stop ndnpingserver

# you may not have anything in /usr/local/bin that starts with 'ndn'
# some older installations did. This is just getting it out of the
# way, just in case. Later we will hopefully remove it.
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo mkdir NDN
sudo mv ndn* NDN

# upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo initctl stop nfd
sudo apt-get install ndn-tools

cd /etc/default
sudo rm ndnpingserver  ndnping
cd ../init
sudo rm ndnpingserver.conf ndnping.conf

# Now in your ndn-ops repository.
cd ndn-ops/named-data/nfd_v0.3
git pull

cd etc_default
sudo cp ndnping.verisign /etc/default/ndnping

cd ../Upstart
sudo cp ndnping.conf /etc/init/
sudo cp nfdstat_c.conf /etc/init
sudo cp nfdDataCollector_c.conf /etc/init

cd ..

#if you already have an ndnmap directory:
cd ndnmap
git pull

#if the ndnmap directory doesn't exist already then do this instead
git clone http://github.com/WU-ARL/ndnmap
cd ndnmap


cd nfdDataCollection
./waf clean
./waf configure
./waf
sudo ./waf install

# This is another use of the nfdDataCollection code:
cd ../../../NOC/nfdDataCollection
./waf clean
./waf configure
./waf

# Now we try to start everything
sudo initctl start nfd

# Wait a couple of minutes and then check /var/log/upstart
cd /var/log/upstart
ls -ltr | tail -10
sleep 10
ls -ltr | tail -10

# And see if there is anything nfd* or ndn* related that seems to be continually restarting.
# if so, it means I missed something...



#Then at the end if everything is working you can remove /usr/local/bin/NDN
